Start a React app
-----------------
This command creates a basic build process for creating a SPA react app.

.. code-block::

    npx create-react-app my-app-name

Theory & Concepts
#################

It's a Library
--------------
* Used for composing UI's from components.
* Not to be confused with a Framework such as React Native, Angular or VUE.
* Pure React components are essentially Javascript syntactic sugar

React Component
---------------
* Tells React what the client should see (aka Render)
* A JS function that returns JSX - aka **React Elements**
* JSX is Reacts syntax for HTML + JS, for example

.. code-block::

    return <h1>{greetings}</h1>

* In order for JSX to compile it must have at least 1 <a> tag
* The reason JSX is used is because it makes writing React Components easier. For example;

.. code-block::

    <h1> == React.createElement(h1....);

Interactive Component

Composition
-----------
* This is what occurs when a JS Function component contains a react component

Props
-----
* Essential parameters or arguments for passing data down into children objects or functions.
* To me, Props is peculiar in that it will contain functions to modify high level state.
* Can be left empty, however authoritative sources say it's best to include props argument even when not needed.

State
-----
* Every component can have a state
* this.state should be private to its components
* It's always a good idea for state to be "lifted up" as much as possible

React Virtual DOM
_________________
* A Tree based virtual representation of your DOM.
* Used for identifying the changes in state from your virtual DOM in comparison to your actual DOM
* This comparison process is called "Diffing"
* This procedure is why React is condidered effecient since it **only** updates the changes in DOM
