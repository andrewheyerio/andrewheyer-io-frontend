Welcome to Andrews Notes!
=========================
The documentation that I have hosted here is primarily for assisting me in internalizing concepts that I have learned. I
also use this space as an oppourtunity to organize my notes and create useful flashcards. This process is what works for
me in order to truly grasp the everychanging landscape of technology. To me, this is essential for keeping my skillset
current and improving my ability to apply what I have learned to my day to day work. For any outsiders visiting this
page, hopefully it can serve you as a point of reference for getting a quick look at concepts relating to any of the
technologies found here.

.. note::
   If you wish to apply the same method of learning into your own routine, here are the steps.

   1. Find an authoritative guide which covers basic principles and core concepts for a tech you want to learn.
   2. Work through the guide, distilling the information into Cornell style notes.
   3. Organize notes onto a self served documentation site, AKA Andrew's Notes. If you are like me, try to make this
      site useful for *you*. Much like that of a cheat sheet for an exam.
